# Fork of COVID-19 Tracker
Based on https://twitter.com/PEDELCODE/status/1285174445074767872.
Reworked the code slightly by:
- Changing the messages presented to user
- Allowing users to view more than one country within a single program run
*The code was re-written, based on the Facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/pedelcode/photos/pcb.138836911221991/138836847888664/

You can recreate this yourself easily once you use pip to install the covid library:
pip install covid
