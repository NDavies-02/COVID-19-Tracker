# COVID-19 Statistics

Fork of PEDEL-CODE/Covid-Tracker from commit `#872381b`.
This version is the CLI version and does not include Tkinter GUI from later upstream commits (`#d8cc80c`).

This is a simple Python program to quickly view basic statistics on COVID-19 cases and deaths for a given country.

The following changes were made in the initial fork (release v1.3)

- The messages shown to the user were updated to be more friendly.
- Multiple countries can be viewed within a single program run.

Please see the changes made in the final release v2.0. It is advisale not to download older versions as they use significantly older packages.
